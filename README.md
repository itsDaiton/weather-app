Simple application that takes user's input and returns current weather conditions for that specific location. In case of invalid location name, the application will warn user and produce an error message. If the location exists, the application will return following information:
- Image representing current weather condition
- Current temperature (in degrees Celcius)
- Weather description (Scattered Clouds, Broken Clouds, Haze, Clear...)
- Feels Like temperature (in degrees Celcius)
- Min. possible temperature (in degrees Celcius)
- Max. possible temperature (in degrees Celcius)
- Humidity (%)
- Wind (km/h)
- Visibility (km)
- Pressure (hPa)

Users can also clear the input element, which will result in size decrease of the container.
